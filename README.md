Vue is a progressive framework for creating impressive user interfaces. If looked at its core, it is focused on the view layer of an application.

Integrating Vue JS with various other platforms or existing applications is quite simple.

It is extensible, simple, interesting, and innovative to create single web page applications.

Data binding is a big problem for the front-end world. Now, we are more focused on data instead of micromanaging the DOM as we used to do with Jquery in the past. Vue has the amazing capability of handling this easily with a two-way reactive data binding system.
